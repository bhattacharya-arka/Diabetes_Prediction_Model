# Diabetes_Prediction_Model
This is a Diabetes predition model based on the PIMA dataset available on kaggle.
This model has been built using the Support Vector Machine Classifier.
Since the model has been trained on a pretty small dataset the accuracy scores are not that great but they aren't bad either.
